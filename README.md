The Easy Music Organizer is currently being rewritten in Go...\
It will soon be a clean HTTP API with multi-user support,
authentication and much more features and abilities!

PS: [curl.conf](/curl.conf) contains the JWT of the default admin user.
It can be used for testing and is NOT a token leak!
